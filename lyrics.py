lyric="""In the darkest silence
Sothing seems to satisfy
Shout of noise, Brain the mad
So fly freedom eternity

Screaming out of the world
Destroy misery
Trying high, white out
Judgement day is the forgot

The endless time in mind
Even if life comes to an end
The ring sound is eternal for my voice
Open the arms

My heart and soul's live in the waves drive
Fly high torn feeling moment for the all myself
Flash back the long of distance, many battle ray
Try to after fire Louder than steel

Feeling ray to avenge
Return to my beat sound
Shout of noise, brain the mad
So fly freedom eternity

Wave is come to mind
Even if life comes to an end
The rising sun is eternal for my blood
Open the arms

My heart and soul's live in the waves drive
Fly high torn feeling moment for the all myself
Flash back the long of distance, many battle ray
Try to after fire Louder than steel

The endless time in mind
Even if life comes to an end
The ring sound is eternal for my voice
Open the arms

My heart and soul's live in the waves drive
Fly high torn feeling moment for the all myself
Flash back the long of distance, many battle ray
Try to after fire Louder than steel"""
